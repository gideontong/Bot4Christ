# Bot4Christ

A Discord bot for Christian communities to use. Welcome to the 21st century. This bot uses Discord's Slash Commands feature, and as such, you'll need to grant the appropiate permissions in Oauth flow.

## Add to Server

## Installation

Node.js 16.13.0 or newer is required.

```bash
npm cleaninstall
```

## Development

You can see the `CONTRIBUTING` file for a list of things that need to be done. Development is rapid and not for the faint of heart, as I don't have resources to devote to teaching. If you wish to contribute to this project anyways without programming experience, please see the `CONTRIBUTING` file anyways. There's also a list of things to do there.

### Unit Tests

Who needs that? If you want to write a mock for this Discord bot, you're welcome to and file a pull request. I'm happy to take a look.
